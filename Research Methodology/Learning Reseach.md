## Leanring Reasearch 

- repository: [LINK](https://github.com/pengsida/learning_research)

- general ideas:
  - find research focus
  - propose your solutions
  - carry out experiments
  - write paper
  - give presentations
 

## At the Beginning

### Stage 1

- basic ideas & key concepts
- breath ✔️ depth ❎:
- Algorithms -> fundamental principles -> application scenes
- More practice
- Google or new bing

### Stage 2
- research project in a lab
- depth ✔️: details of algotihms & coding
- purpose: build up foundation for subdivision
- Roadmaps:
    - find a direction : from introductive info from lab. [EXAMPLE](https://pengsida.notion.site/38a877c2debb4fb79d3188d64703dab5)
    - create your specific study roadmap (with the help of researchers in the lab) [EXAMPLE](https://pengsida.notion.site/8911dcc5922b4442a80d4407926e65bf)
    - take several courses (free from time-consuming homework)
    - presence at weekly discussion of projects in the lab

> - Abilities required:
>   - literature review/ literature tree / tracking SOTA techniques
>   - goal-driven research / creativity
>   - coding / experimenting / failure analysis
>   - writing papers / presentation / making demo
>   - communication skills
>- Steps of carrying out research projects
>   - find crucial tasks
>   - find technical challenges / failure case to be solved
>   - propose solutions
>   - disentangle your thoughts & logics
>   - check correctness and novalty
>   - design demo experiments
>   - improve your solution
>   - find more solution candidates
>   - tuning until your solution works
>   - find out what to do next
>   - set deadlines : ablations study & introduction writing & method writing & abstract writing & experiment writing & related work writing
>   - write paper (how to create a demo ?)
>   - paper review : missing experiments & writing flaws
>   - improve the paper
